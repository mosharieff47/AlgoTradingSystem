# Algo Trading System

### THIS IS NOT A MONEY MAKING MACHINE. THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!

## Description
This is a full-stack web application which is an Algorithmic Trading System I have built which trades XBTUSD on Kraken. The server is written using Python's asynchronus framework along with React.js to display the trades, orderbook, and the PnL which occurs after each trade.
